### Considerations

- Attempting an MVP with limited time.
- What if the data is extremely large.
- A better solution to caching via JSON would be use Redis or a database.
- My algorithm for finding possible duplicates is not efficient for very large data set. Consider n-grams or another solution.
- Error handling could be much better.

### Nice to Haves
- Deploy it somewhere.
- Use CSS transitions.
- Paginate results on the client.
- Incorporate the SalesLoft logo.
- Better error handling.
- Launch via a make file.
